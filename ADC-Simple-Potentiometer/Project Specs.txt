This system is designed to change the illumination of the built in LEDs on the Launchpad. 

--Using ADC on a signal from a 10k Potentiometer, the output was varied accordingly.

To calculate the sample values, the following formula was used. ----> Digital Sample = (Analog Input (volts) â€¢ 4095) / 3.3V(volts)

The outputs were configured as follows:

	--Red illuminates with Potentiomater below 1.4V, calculated value of 1760

	--Blue illuminates with Potentiomater between 1.4V and 2.5V, range of 1760 < Vpot < 3112

	--Green illuminates with Potentiomater above 2.5V.
